We will need to convert the fitted peak flux densities into total flux densities before we can plot the source counts. To calculate the total flux density we just need to multiply the peak flux density by the area of the source. Peak flux densities are measured in units of mJy/beam and total flux density is just in units of mJy, so the area of the source we use should be in units of the beam. The sources in the NVSS catalogue are fitted with an elliptical Gaussian model. The beam of the NVSS (which we defined at the beginning of this tutorial) is also an elliptical Gaussian. We therefore just need to multiply the peak flux densities by the areas in units of the NVSS beam. This should be: totalflux=peakflux x (majsize x minsize) / (NVSSBEAM x NVSSBEAM)"
